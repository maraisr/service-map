# Service Map

> :construction: WIP - Watch this space.

So you have your suite of fancy microservices, now how do you know they are even up? Yeah you have your alarms, but they'll only alarm if the service is even there.

TODO:

- [ ] Add a config layer to all of this
- [ ] Add the "What should be there" config
- [ ] Let the api actually call eureka or the indicators
- [ ] Clean up the api
- [ ] All the `// TODO`'s the app still has
- [ ] Searchable widgets
